# Nether Pearls
Nether Pearls allow players to teleport from the overworld to nether or vice versa.  
They are thrown exactly like ender pearls, and teleport the player to their coordinates in the nether / overworld.  
For Example: 
- Pearl lands at Overworld(100, 100) teleports to Nether(800, 800)
- Pearl lands at Nether(800, 800) teleports to Overworld(100, 100)

There is also a safe nether pearl which will place a block under the player and clear space so they will not suffocate. Safe nether pearls can be made with any block.
